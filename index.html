             but i know to my self that this all person has not existing in this world.
            I enjoy spending my time on this platform, wheree i can explore a wide variety of genres and creative storytelling.
            Wattpad allows me to dive into relatable, emotional and sometimes dramatic narratives written by aspiring writers.
            I also love reading jonaxx stories because of her unique writing style and unforgetable characters that always leave 
            a lasting impact. whether it's a comic on webtoon or a novel by jonaxx, reading has become my favorite escape from reality.

        <p class="proud">I remember this day clearly, it was one of the proudest moments of my cadet life.
            the sun was high and the heat was intense, but the excitement and energy kept us going.
            We stood tall in our uniform side by side, ready to represent our unit during event.
            i was nervous at first but bieng with my fellow cadets gave me confidence. the two of us
            in blue stood between our comrades in camouflage and together we looked sharp and united.
            people were watching, some cheering, others taking photos and it made me feel proud of everything
            we had trained for. The flags waving in the background and sound of commands being called
            out created an atmosphere I'll never forget. This photo it reminds me of teamwork, discipline and friendships we built along the way.
